--This document provides a guide for synthesizing simulated current or voltage waveforms generated in the XSCHEM schematic editor . The waveforms obtained from XSCHEM transient simulations can be reproduced on any compatible instrument. As an example, this guide demonstrates waveform synthesis from XSCHEM using the Keithley 2450 SourceMeter Unit (SMU).

-- By pressing CTRL + Click on START SYNTHESIS (launcher.sym), the simulated waveform data is sent to the SourceMeter Unit, and the output of the SourceMeter will switched on.

--Similarly, pressing CTRL + Click on STOP SYNTHESIS, will switch off the output of the Sourcemeter.

-- Used Python and PyVISA library to configure the Sourcemeter (Make sure the instrument supports SCPI)

-- Use launcher.sym to start the execution of your Python script.

--Launch the shell script run_python.sh fromlauncher.sym to run the Python script in the background, allowing Xschem to remain active during execution. 

--To terminate or abort the trigger, use the Tcl script stop_script.tcl, which can also be launched via launcher.sym (This setup provides a convenient way to control both the start and stop of the arbitrary current or voltage wave
generation)

**Configuration of Keithley 2450 SourceMeter**

-- Create and store a Source Configuration List that can includes settings such as voltage or current ranges,
maximum limits, specific values and other relevant settings.

--Current or voltage values stored in a .csv file can be
loaded into a Python array and incorporated into this Source Configuration List.

--Configure Timer 1 on the 2450 SMU to set the required time intervals for your source steps.

--Build a Trigger Model to invoke the Source Configuration List. This will source the desired current or
voltage values at each defined time step. The trigger model ensures that the SMU automatically applies each
source setting in synchronization with the configured timer steps.
